Software to analyze my diary, run through CLI. idk how to do READMEs
The main diary file, a parent directory to this software, is organized in directories by year, with each file being listed as "Mmm DD.txt" 
I've got a couple of ideas for things I could do with the information I can get from my entries, but the process should involve reading all the entries when the program starts, storing all the words in a txt file with a second txt file to store all the details.
>> words
    - list every word w/ frequency
>> entries
    - list years, with a count of how many entries are in each
